Project Proposal: Group 3 
Project Title: Impact of Covid-19 on WA Crime Rates 
Team Members: Sri Vegunta, Petra Moyle, Fern Bradder, Pravakar Neupane
Project Description/outline: 
Our project is to understand the impacts of covid-19 on the WA Crime rates. 
Our data explores the WA crime rates from 2007 to 2020.  We'll examine relationships between types of crime in WA, WA metro and WA regional areas by the timelines: pre covid timeline (Pre Mar 2020), lockdown period (Mar2020) and post covid (Post Mar 2020); identify trends in crime rates for the three timelines; and related questions, as the data admits.
Research questions to answer: 
1)	What positive/negative impact has Covid-19 lockdowns had on the different types of crime rates and have these impacts continued past lockdown period in 2020. 
2)	Can we explain the trends in the crime rates with additional supportive data?
Data Sources:
Police Database: Crime Statistics | Western Australia Police Force
Rough Breakdown of tasks:
Day 1 (22nd Apr) 
Create a Pandas Dataframe of the entire WA, Metro and Regional excel worksheets. 
Clean the data where required and prepare the Dataframe for analysis.
Day2(27th Apr) 
Take each branch and perform descriptive stats:
Timelines in Consideration: 
•	Pre covid timeline (Pre Mar 2020)
•	Lockdown period (Mar2020) 
•	Post covid (Post Mar 2020)

1)	Line graphs comparing all the different crimes (Yearly), March 2019 – Dec 2020
2)	Insights on the most prominent, least prominent crimes for the timelines.
3)	Outliers in the data 
4)	Crimes with the highest correlation?
Day3(29th Apr) 
Compare the results from each other and find more trends that can be explored further. 
Day4(03rd May) 
Create the presentation slides for the presentation.
